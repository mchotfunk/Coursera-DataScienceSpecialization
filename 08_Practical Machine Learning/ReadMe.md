## Review for Practical Machine Learning:

** Rating: 4 out of 5 **

This is the most useful course in the specialization. The lecturer explained the concept in a relatively reasonable pace and in detailed. Other than theory, there are many hands-on cases you can practice during the class. The course covers the “caret” package in R, which is very useful in today’s machine learning. Lecturer demonstrates many different approaches to complete a specific objective— and you can choose the one that makes you feel the most convenient and comfortable. Highly recommend this course, but be prepared to handle a lot of content! (check my class notes to get what I’m saying)
