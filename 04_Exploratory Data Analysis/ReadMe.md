## Reviews for Exploratory Analysis:

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

This course covers useful plotting system in R, and I found the ggplot most useful. 

Lecturer explained the concept quite concise and clear. It’s very easy to get to know how the structure for a ggplot is. This course features with practical hands-on assignment which you can practice skills you learned in this class. 

However, some of the contents might not be suitable to be addressed in this course, for example the K-means clustering. It is explained in a fast pace and did not cover completely. 

Overall, it’s a good course worth to take.
