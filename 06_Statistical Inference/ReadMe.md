## Review for Statistical Inference:

**Rating: 1 out of 5**

This is the worst class in the specialization, period.

The lecturer tries to cover a lot of concept at the speed of light and assumes that you have a strong background in statistics. Even for me, a master student who takes marketing analytics concentration and learned statistics just months ago, I still struggled a lot and had a hard time. 

This course is so poorly managed that many people also complain at the online forum, and I have no idea why the lecturer hasnâ€™t updated the class. 

The good thing is that it motivates me to review my stats, reminding me of the nightmare once again.
