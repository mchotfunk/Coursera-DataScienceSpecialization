## Review for Regression Model:

**Rating: 3 out of 5**

This course is slightly better than the statistical inference. It teaches you how to interpret the result of a regression model and how to handle the data if you are trying to fit a linear regression. (e.g. create dummy variables). It also covers some concepts of statistics ( over fitting, variance inflation factors…). However, the problem in this course is the same with the statistical inference: It tries to cover a lot of concept within a short period of time and did not explain well. Whenever the lecturer introduces a concept, he simulates some random data in R to justify the statistical functions, which I think it’s not what I need to learn and not practical at all.
