## Review for Reproducible Research:

**Rating:  3 out of 5**

This class teaches you how to develop reproducible research using R-Markdown. It’s very practical and essential in today’s data science industry. If you want to build your own Github, you should understand how to use R-markdown file to record the work you’ve done and let others to reproduce it. 

But there are some handy cheatsheets for syntax of R-markdown online. Simply following the cheatsheet should enable you to write R-markdown files. This class seems a little bit redundant and not necessary for me (just personal opinion). 

However, the assignment in this class handles well— It offers you an opportunity to practice what you’ve learned in previous class and give you an idea of how a report should look like.
