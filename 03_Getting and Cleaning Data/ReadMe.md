## Reviews for Getting and Cleaning Data:

**Rating: 3 out of 5**

This course covers from getting data online (e.g. read HTML files) to making the data tidy. 

The contents starting from week 3 are very useful: It teaches you how to subset and sort the data, clean the missing values and create new variables in your data frame. In addition, the introduction to “dplyr” is also killing— the most practical package and skill I will surely apply in the future. Finally, the lecture also covers finding values in text, which implements frequently in the upcoming projects in this specialization. 

It’s a pity that the project in this course only requires you to merge the tables. It will be better if we can practice the data manipulating skill in the project.
