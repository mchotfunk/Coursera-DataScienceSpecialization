## Reviews for R-Programming

**Rating: 1 out of 5**

This is the toughest course in this specialization. (Yes, and it is at the beginning).

The content addressing in this class is very basic: Write a simple for-loop, introduction to self-defined functions, subset the data and the “Apply-related” functions.

However, the projects (assignment) in this course are so much different —  it requires way more research online and nearly none of the required skills are covered in the lecture (that escalated quickly).

To sum up, this course is poorly managed and if you are not familiar with R (at least intermediate level), you will be very frustrated and start doubting yourself.
