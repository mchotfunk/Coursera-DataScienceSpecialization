Data Science Capstone:

Rating: 1 out of 5

This Capstone is not a course— it requires you to apply what you’ve learned from this specialization and do a final project. It is odd because the project is nothing related to previous works— You need to develop a Natural Language Processing App. So I start searching what is NLP, and what is the algorithm behind it. I spend almost 3 weeks to come up with a simple Shiny App.
